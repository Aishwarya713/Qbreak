# Qbreak
Qbreak is a virtual queue system that allows the user to avoid crowded waiting rooms/lines and ensure social distancing. It helps the user to arrive at a particular location just in time. 
Initially it focuses on the healthcare employees and patients but it can be used to serve any case regarding crowded locations. As soon as the patient fixes an appointment , he or she will be queued and will be notified when it is the time to go or if there is any delay. Patients can check into the queue line safely from home.
